# Local Development Environment

To Get Started with the DBM Visualizer Project......

## Repository

When working in Development, a local Repository is required to store models as we won't be using the online storage server.
Under the C: drive create a Repository directory. At the root of the directory, folders are created for each of the CompanyId(Guid).
